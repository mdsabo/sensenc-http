			<h2>Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs)</h3>
			<img class="center fit" src="img/about_mip.jpg" alt="About: SenseNC MIPs">
			<p>Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) are polymer layers with lock-and-key type indentations embedded into them.  When a sample containing the target molecule is introduced to the polymer layer the molecule fits into the indentations in the polymer layer like a lock and key.  This bonding can then be measured using electrical signals and correlated to the concentration of the target in the sample.</p>

			<p>
			Advantages of the MIP layer:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The lock-and-key style provides a high level of specificity for the assay.</li>  
				<li>The MIP can be created for a wide variety of different target molecules.</li>  
				<li>Bonding promoter peptides can be added to the MIP to increase the effectiveness of the MIP layer.</li>

			<h2>The Miptide</h3>
			<img class="center fit" src="img/about_assay.jpg" alt="About: SenseNC Miptide">
			<p>The Miptide is meant to be portable and easy to operate.  It can be run from either wall or battery power and delivers results quickly via the built in display.  The assay cartriges containing the sample slide into the front of the device and are fully disposable.  After each sample is taken measurement data can also be sent to a mobile device and the cloud.</p>

			<h2>Hardware</h3>
			<img class="center fit" src="img/about_hardware.jpg" alt="About: SenseNC Hardware">
			<ol>
				<li>
					The device can be powered through wall power or the onboard battery and has built in battery charging capability.
				</li>
				<li>
					The sample is injected onto an electrode array that is used to pass current through the sample.
				</li>
				<li>
					Vancomycin limits the current through the electrodes which can be measured as impedance.  An Analog Devices 5933 intregrated circuit mounted on a Digilent PmodIA is used to measure and analyze the impedance.  Results are sent to the primary microcontroller.
				</li>
				<li>
					The nRF52Dk serves as the primary microcontroller of the system and drives all of the device operations.
				</li>

			<h2>Software</h3>
			<img class="center fit" src="img/about_software.jpg" alt="About: SenseNC Software">
			<ol>
				<li>
					The sensor is driven by custom C++ code built on top of the mbed standard RTOS library.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Android Application was designed using Android Studio and is written in Java and XML.
				</li>
				<li>
					The web server is hosted on the Heroku web platform and runs a Javascript backend based on the NodeJS library.  This is connected to a SQLite3 database for storing and retrieving samples.  The viewable webpages (this one) are written in HTML and CSS.
				</li>
				<li>
					The server can serve HTTP requests from any web-enabled device and could be used to stream information directly to a hospital patient database for continuous monitoring.
				</li>
