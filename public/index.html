				<li>
					The device can be powered through wall power or the onboard battery and has built in battery charging capability.
				</li>
				<li>
					The sample is injected onto an electrode array that is used to pass current through the sample.
				</li>
				<li>
					Vancomycin limits the current through the electrodes which can be measured as impedance.  An Analog Devices 5933 intregrated circuit mounted on a Digilent PmodIA is used to measure and analyze the impedance.  Results are sent to the primary microcontroller.
				</li>
				<li>
					The nRF52Dk serves as the primary microcontroller of the system and drives all of the device operations.
				</li>

			<ol>
				<li>
					The sensor is driven by custom C++ code built on top of the mbed standard RTOS library.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Android Application was designed using Android Studio and is writen in Java and XML.
				</li>
				<li>
					The web server is hosted on the Heroku web platform and runs a Javascript backend based on the NodeJS library.  This is connected to a SQLite3 database for storing and retrieving samples.  The viewable webpages (this one) are wirtten in HTML and CSS.
				</li>
				<li>
					The server can serve HTTP requests from any web-enabled device and could be used to stream information directly to a hospital patient database for continuous monitoring.
				</li>
